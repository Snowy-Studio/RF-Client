A simple XNA Framework / MonoGame UI library built for personal and Command & Conquer modding community needs. While general-purpose, publicly it is currently only used in CnCNet projects:

- CnCNet Client: https://github.com/CnCNet/xna-cncnet-client
- World-Altering Editor: https://github.com/CnCNet/WorldAlteringEditor

Due to the limited usage scope, there is no documentation, and the library is not recommended for general public consumption. MonoGame users looking for UI solutions for their games are recommended to turn to other options instead.



If you still wish to utilize this library regardless of these disclaimers, you can look into the `GameClass.cs` files of the aforementioned projects for usage examples.
